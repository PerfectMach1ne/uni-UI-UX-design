# uni-UI-UX-design

This repository stores a PDF export of a Figma project from my university class in UI/UX design.
For the class, we had to design a website in 3 stages - wireframe, prototype and mockup.
If you'd like to have access to the Figma project, message me at the mail provided in the commit and I'll invite you.
